COMP140 Project- Norman the interactive Robot(open source).

This project the aim of this project is to see how advanced I can make a robot with a midrange AI camera
(HuskyLens) and how the camera communicates with the other components. I will explore
how interactive and lifelike I could make a robot.



The robot will be powered by a state machine that switches through the states mostly by
input from the Bluetooth App.
• The robot aims to explore the depth of lifelike interactions and how effectively a personality
will be constructed.
• The range of manufacturing techniques and CAD designs will give the robot its own unique
characteristics.
• My personal aim of this project is to get users to start addressing the robot as if it was a
living thing by using pronouns and naming the robot ( I have already been encouraged to
name it myself, I have named it Norman).
